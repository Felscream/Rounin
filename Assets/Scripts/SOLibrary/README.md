# ScriptableObject-Library
A collection of the most common used scriptable object cases I use through out my videos. It includes variables in data containers and scriptable object events. Plus some additional helper scripts to work with, such as True/False event stacks based on bools / gameObject states and numeric comparisons. There's also a few other utility scripts.

# How to use
Just include the namespace SO to access the data containers for the variables. 
Any UI helper script is is under SO.UI
